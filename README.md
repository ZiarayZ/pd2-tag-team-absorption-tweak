# Tag Team's Absorption Tweak
A payday 2 mod aimed at tweaking how tag team's ability functions.
<br>
-Absorption now stays active until 60 seconds after the tag effect ends (regardless of cooldown).<br>
-Use throwable ability to cancel this effect before the 60 seconds is up.<br>
-Cannot tag another unit until after the 60 seconds or after the effect is cancelled.<br>
<br><br>
Tag Team now works as follows:<br>
-Tag a team unit like normal.<br>
-The tagged ability works like normal.<br>
-Once the duration ends, this mod activates.<br>
-Extends the duration of absorption for 60 seconds.<br>
-Using the throw keybind will cancel this absorption early.<br>
<br>
Normally if the duration of tag team lasts longer than the cooldown, the absorption disappears as soon as the duration ends.<br>
The purpose of this tweak is to make the absorption gained last after the duration even when the cooldown is over.
